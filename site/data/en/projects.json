Our goal is to create a minimalist version of bash, immersing ourselves in the nuances of shell programming. We focus on fundamental aspects such as command input handling, file directory manipulation, environment variable interpretation, and implementing essential features like signal handling and command execution. This project is an important step toward a deep understanding of system programming, offering practical experience with key concepts used in Unix/Linux shell environments.",
